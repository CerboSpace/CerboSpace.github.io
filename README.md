Introduction: We are a group of Machine Learning scientists specializing in imbuing your systems with intelligence. We are passionate about solving complex problems and our solutions are customized incorporating ideas and concepts from the cutting edge scientific literature.   

Workflow: (Basically the services that we offer):
A plan or a roadmap. 
Collect data if you have a limited dataset
Survey the literature to get you the best solution
Test the models
Optimize the computing power
Integrate the model into your workspace
Maintain: Retrain models, optimize the hyperparameters etc.

WORKFLOW:
1. We analyse your problem and create a roadmap for execution.
2. We collect the data from you and, if possible, collect the data for you.
3. We conduct an extensive literature survey and develop a diverse array of models to test your data on.
4. Once we have hit upon the right model, we optimise the code and the computing performance
5. We subsequently integrate the model into your workflow and perform routine maintenance to ensure the models never stop learning.
